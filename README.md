# photos by the sofa

I've been working on my web based photo album software since 1997.
It's gone through many iterations and lots of technologies.  This is
the next one.

Here we have a 1-tier [couchapp][couchapp] based photo app that allows
fully meshed distributed fun stuff with photos.

For those unfamiliar with couchapps or couchdb in general.  Think
about the picture above.  You can do anything anywhere and just sync
it all around.

Awesome.

Check out my [public photo album][public] for an example.
